# Leetcode
## Leetcode challenges solutions in C#, Javascript and Go.
I've tackled LeetCode challenges, providing solutions in **C#**, **JavaScript**, and **Go**. 

My approach emphasizes a balance between **simplicity**, **memory efficiency**, and **performance**, which aligns with my typical software development priorities. 

Since each challenge is accompanied by a LeetCode link, I haven't extensively commented the code. 

Feel free to explore those solutionsâ€”you might find alternatives you prefer over mine." ðŸ˜Š
