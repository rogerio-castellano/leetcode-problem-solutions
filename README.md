# Leetcode
Leetcode challenges solutions in C#, Javascript and Go.
I tried to balance simplicity, memory usage and performance, as I usually try to prioritize in the software I develop.
As each challenge comes with the LeetCode link, I haven't worried about commenting the code. Maybe you can find solutions there that you prefer more than mine.
